      <h2>The Design of</h2>
      <h1>Command Records</h1>
      <p>Command Records was founded by Enoch Light in 1959 and is known for its innovative contributions in realm of
        high fidelity and stereo sound. The label specialized in producing recordings that showcased the advancements
        in technology that sought to exploit the capabilities of stereo sound to create recordings that were not only
        musically engaging but also demonstrated the spatial effects and clarity that stereo could offer.</p>

      <p>The label is famous for its "Persuasive Percussion" and "Provocative Percussion" series, <a
          href="https://designobserver.com/feature/command-records-design-distinction/40269" target="new">which were
          notable for their distinctive cover art</a> that became iconic for the era. Under the
        eye of art director <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/designers/4355/charles-e-murphy">Charles E. Murphy</a>, he
        created some of the label's most visually striking album covers with
        bold, imaginative designs that often incorporated vibrant colors, abstract forms, and experimental typography.
        Murphy also recruited well known designers of the day including <a
          href="https://proxymusic.club/2018/07/19/josef-albers-command-records/" target="new">Josef Albers</a>, <a
          href="https://www.rit.edu/carycollection/george-giusti">George Guisti</a>
        and <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/thekuhlmanarchive/neil-fujita/"
          target="new">S. Neil Fujita</a>. Many of these designs have made it into <a href="https://moma.org/artists/46715"
          target="new">the MoMA</a>, and remain affordable
        and accessible to collectors today as mostly bargain bin and thrift store records despite their design pedigree.
